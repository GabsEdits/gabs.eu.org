# Draft Blog Posts

An folder for draft blog posts. Drafts are not shown on the blog list, but can be accessed directly via their URL. This is useful for sharing drafts with others for feedback before publishing them.

Drafts could end up not being published at all, or they could be published at a later date. Drafts are not included in the RSS feed.

If you saw this page using the web browser, you found a secret! ðŸŽ‰

And I don't know how you got here, but I'm glad you did! :D

~~Don't tell anyone about it!~~ :shushing_face:

Also, I am not planing to add a list of draft posts here, as it would defeat the purpose of drafts, technically these should be private, and only on my local machine, but I like to share them with others for feedback. So, if you have a link to a draft post, you can access it, but you can't access the list of drafts ;)

That's pretty much it.
