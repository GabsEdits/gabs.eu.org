**Notes:**

1. This article is coming from a person that has been daily driving Linux with the GNOME Desktop Environment for a while. Of course any criticism is coming from that perspective.

2. The device I am using is the base model of the MacBook Air M1 2020 (8GB RAM, 256GB).

Recently, I got myself an MacBook Air, my first _MacOS_ device. Since when I got it, I planned to switch to Asahi Linux, but due to the lack of support for Thunderbolt (that is neecessary if you have a laptop with 3 ports from which 2 are Thunderbolt), I decided to stick with MacOS till the support is there.

I have been using MacOS for a bit now, and I have some thoughts about it.

## The Good

First of all, MacOS looks pretty nice, while the workflow is not as great as GNOME, it's still pretty good. The animations are smooth, and the overall experience is nice.
