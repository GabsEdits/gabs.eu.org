Most likely scrapped, but I will keep it here for now.

You most likely have heard about Web3 by now. It's a term that has been thrown around a lot lately, especially in the tech industry. A new *hipe*, or rather the old hipe, since <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> and <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> are the new hipe by now.

But what exactly is Web3, and what does it mean for the future of the internet?

## Definition

Web3 as it is - a term that refers to a new version of the internet that is decentralized, open-source, and community-driven. It is a vision of the internet that is not controlled by a single entity, but rather by the community as a whole.

Web3 is built on blockchain technology, which is a decentralized ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. This technology allows for the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) that run on a blockchain network.
