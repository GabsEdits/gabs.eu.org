<figcaption>Human, Front-end Developer & Open Source Contributor.</figcaption>


Salut! I'm a human person, but also a designer and developer with a passion for creating beautiful and intuitive experiences. My name is Gabriel, also known as Gabs, and I am located in Moldova. I specialize in Web Development and am currently trying out other things that I might also enjoy. Since I contribute to a lot of other things, why not check out my open-source projects and profile on GitHub and who knows, maybe in the future, I'll add some to GitLab too. GitHub is the main area where you'll find me, as almost, if not everything I do, is based there. With time, I started working on more and more things.

In May 2023, I started working on my first-ever project that is not for myself. I spent about 3 months developing a website for the company Boekestijn in Moldova, and that marked the beginning of my new product Aeolus. Currently, it's built with Vue.js 3 & Vite. The website was a big success and a milestone for my career. Following that, I began my more professional work and started working for other companies that need websites. **If you are looking for a website contact me.** You can also check out more or almost all of my projects on my [Projects page](/projects).

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and learning new skills to make a positive impact on the world through my work :D
