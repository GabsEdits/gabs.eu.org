<h1>Gabriel Cozma <small>Gabs</small></h1>
<small>Human, Front-end Developer & Open Source Contributor.</small>


Salut! I'm a human person, but also a designer and developer with a passion for creating beautiful and intuitive experiences. My name is Gabriel, also known as Gabs, and I am located in Moldova. I specialize in Web Development and am currently trying out other things that I might also enjoy. Since I contribute to a lot of other things, why not check out my open-source projects and profile on my [My Git Profiles](/findme#contributions). **GitHub** is the main area where you'll find me, as almost, if not everything I do, is based there. With time, I started working on more and more things.

In May of 2023, I started working on my first-ever project that is not for myself. I spent about 3 months developing a website for the company Boekestijn in Moldova, and that marked the beginning of my new product [Aeolus](https://gabs.eu.org/aeolus). It's built with Vue.js 3 & Vite and the website was a big success and a milestone for my career. Following that, I began my more professional work and started working for other companies that need websites. **If you are looking for a website [contact me](/findme).** 

Feel free to explore additional or nearly all of my projects on the [Projects page](/projects).

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and learning new skills to make a positive impact on the world through my work :D
