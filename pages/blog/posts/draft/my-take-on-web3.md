Web3 is a term that has been thrown around a lot lately, especially in the tech community. But what exactly is Web3 and what does it mean for the future of the internet?

## What even 'is' Web3?

In simple terms, Web3 is the next evolution of the internet. It is a decentralized version of the web that is built on blockchain technology. This means that instead of relying on centralized servers to host websites and applications, Web3 uses a network of nodes to store and distribute data.

One of the key benefits of Web3 is that it is more secure and private than the current web. Because data is stored on a decentralized network, it is much harder for hackers to access and manipulate it. This makes Web3 a more secure option for storing sensitive information, such as financial data or personal records.

All of these things sound pretty good, until you get deeper.
