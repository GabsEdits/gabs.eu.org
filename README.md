# Aplus Template | Guide

## Start

This is a Template Repo, you can click the button and then clone your newly by following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/*your_username*/aplus
```

Or you can edit your project on the web using GitHub Codespaces, just in your favorite browser open the this link:\
https://codespaces.new/*your_username*/aplos. **Make sure you change your username in the url**

* **To start editing the project run this in your terminal:**

```bash
npm install
```

* **To start your development server run:**

```bash
npm run pages:dev
```

With that, you can go on to open your newly cloned `git` repo in your favorite IDE/Code Editor and open the `/pages/`, then `/.vitepress/` and you will see `config.mts`, that's where you will edit the following:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  lang: "en-US",
  title: "Aplós Template",
  description:
    "This is a cool template for vitepress, it has a lot of features, and it's easy to use",

  lastUpdated: true,
  cleanUrls: true,

  themeConfig: { // Main Theme
    author: "You", // Your name
    nav: { // Navigation
      links: [ 
        { text: "Guide", link: "https://aplos.gxbs.me/guide/" },
        { text: "Demo", link: "/demo" },
        // To add more links, just add more objects to the array, with the text and link like so:
        // { text: "Text (The text for the link)", link: "Link" },
      ],
      git: "https://github.com/GabsEdits/aplos-template", // Link to the source code of your site
    },
    footer: {
      // To disable any of these, just set them to false, to enable them, set them to true
      copyright: true,
      poweredBy: true,

      // To change the text of any of these, just change the text in the quotes, if you want to disable it entirely, set show to false
      madeby: {
        show: true,
        name: "You",
        link: "#",
      },
    },
  },
  markdown: {
    container: { // The markdown cards
      warningLabel: "⚠ Warning",
      tipLabel: "Tip",
      dangerLabel: "⚠ Danger",
      infoLabel: "Info",
    },
  },
  head: [ // The head of the page, this is where you put your meta tags
    ["link", { rel: "icon", href: "/favicon.ico" }],
    ["meta", { name: "og:type", content: "website" }],
    ["meta", { name: "og:locale", content: "en" }],
    ["meta", { name: "og:site_name", content: "Template" }],
    [
      "meta",
      {
        name: "og:image",
        content: "https://aplos.gxbs.me/images/aplos-banner.jpg",
      },
    ],
    ["meta", { name: "twitter:card", content: "summary_large_image" }],
    [
      "meta",
      {
        name: "twitter:image",
        content: "https://aplos.gxbs.me/images/aplos-banner.jpg",
      },
    ],
    ["meta", { name: "twitter:title", content: "Aplós" }],
    [
      "meta",
      {
        name: "twitter:description",
        content: "Aplós is a cool template for vitepress",
      },
    ],
    [
      "meta",
      { name: "twitter:url", content: "https://template.aplos.gxbs.me" },
    ],
  ],
  sitemap: { // The sitemap, for SEO
    hostname: "https://template.aplos.gxbs.me", // The hostname (domain) of your site
  },
});
```

::: info
The last lines, located at `nav` are the link in the header/navigation island
:::

With that changed, you are ready to go to the next step:

### Colors

You can change the accent color inside `/pages/.vitepress/theme/styles/color.css`, you can change everything there and make it your own! This is how the file should look:

```css
:root {
  --color-background: #fdfff5;
  --color-background-second: #faffe0;
  --color-header: #fdfff5bd;
  --color-text: #000;

  --color-accent: #9eb036;
  --color-text-secondary: #6c6c6c;
  --color-border: #74747460;

  --base-shadow: 0px 10px 34px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --color-background: #12120e;
    --color-background-second: #21251b;
    --color-header: #12120eb5;
    --color-text: #fff;

    --base-shadow: 0px 10px 34px 0px rgb(0 0 0 / 40%);
  }
}
```

## Start Writing!
Once you've done all that, you are ready to edit you're files, you can create pages in the `pages` folder, and add them to the Navigation Island if you want.
